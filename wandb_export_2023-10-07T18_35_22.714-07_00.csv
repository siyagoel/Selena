1. 8/10 - Respond within one day
2. 9/10 - Respond within one week
3. 10/10 - Respond within one day

The parameters I used to make the ranking decisions were urgency and relevance. I determined the urgency based on the timing of the message, and the relevance based on how pertinent the message was to my interests and needs. For example, the first message was sent late and was not as relevant to me, so I ranked it lower than the other two messages. The second message was more important and relevant to me, so I ranked it higher. The third message was the most urgent and relevant, so I ranked it highest."
